# Quephaestus

> **Forge your own path. Build smarter. Deliver faster.**

## Overview

Quephaestus is a powerful yet flexible scaffolding tool designed to boost developer productivity. Unlike traditional generators that enforce rigid structures, Quephaestus allows you to define **your own templates, folder structures, and DSLs**. Whether you're creating a backend module, a set of configuration files, or any standardized project setup, Quephaestus lets you tailor the process to fit **your** workflow.

## Why "Quephaestus"?

The name "Quephaestus" is a fusion of **"Qu"** (a nod to Quarkus, though the tool is not Quarkus-specific) and **"Hephaestus"**, the Greek god of blacksmithing and craftsmanship. Just as Hephaestus forged legendary tools for the gods, Quephaestus helps developers forge their own tools, modules, and project structures.

## Installation

**Installation is currently TBD.** For now, you can download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](#) (Mac, Linux, Windows executables available).

## Quick start

Quephaestus provides two primary commands for generating files:

```sh
# Forge a Single File
quephaestus forge -f path/to/my/config.yaml -m my-module-name -w path/to/working-directory -b path/to/base-directory my-element-name

# Forge a Blueprint (Multiple Files)
quephaestus forge-blueprint -f path/to/my/config.yaml -m my-module-name -w path/to/working-directory -b path/to/base-directory my-blueprint-name

# -f â†’ Path to the configuration file  
# -m â†’ Module name (used as a contextual grouping for the generated files)  
# -w â†’ Working directory. The root directory where all operations are performed (typically the project's main directory)  
# -b â†’ Base directory. A subdirectory inside the working directory where the forged files should be placed  
# -d â†’ Inline json data For example: -d "{\"name\":"123", \"hello\": \"world\"}"
# -p â†’ Payload. A path to a json file containing mappings for your data   
# <element-name>` or `<blueprint-name>` â†’ The specific element or blueprint to generate.  
```

Forged files will be placed under:

```
[working-directory]/[base-directory]/[module]/[element path]/[filename]
```

Where:
- `[Working directory]` - The root of your project
- `[Base directory]` - A common subdirectory for source files
- `[element path]` - is defined in the `path` field of the configuration file
- `[filename]` - follows the pattern in the `namePattern` field of the configuration file

> ðŸ“˜ **Note**     
> If `-w` and `-b` are omitted, the current directory is used for both.

#### For example: ####  
In a java project named `awesome-project` all files are stored in a folder named `awesome-project`.  
The source files are, generally speaking, stored under `src/main/java/com/awesomeProject/`.
Good candidates for working and base directories are `-w awesome-project -b src/main/java/com/awesomeProject`

## Configuration

Quephaestus relies on a YAML-based configuration file to define **templates and blueprints**.

### Example: ###

```yaml
project: "testproject"
namespace: "com.myproject"
templatesFolder: "./templates"
elements:
  resource:
    path: "boundary/api/{version}"
    namePattern: "{name.toPascalCase}Resource.go"
  orchestrator:
    path: "control"
    namePattern: "{name.toPascalCase}Orchestrator.java"
blueprints:
  full-module:
    elements: [resource, orchestrator]
    mappings:
      name: "{module}"
      version: "v1"
```

## Templates (`.qphs` Files)

Templates are stored in the folder specified by `templatesFolder` and should match element names. For example, if `resource` is an element, its corresponding template file should be `resource.qphs`.

Quephaestus templates follow the **Qute** templating engine syntax. For more details, check out the [Qute documentation](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute).

## Glossary

- **Element** â†’ A reusable components in your DSL, used in your project. Example: `controller`, `repository`, or `orchestrator`
- **Template** â†’ A `.qphs` file that serves as a skeleton for a generated file. It can include Qute expressions and placeholders
- **Module** â†’ A contextual grouping for generated files. Can represent a domain (DDD) or a related set of components
- **Blueprint** â†’ A combination of multiple elements, allowing multiple files to be forged together
- **Working Directory** â†’ The root directory where all operations are performed (usually the main project directory)
- **Base Directory** â†’ A subdirectory inside the working directory where forged files should be placed
- **mappings**: Static values to fill in template placeholders

##  Known issues
* Due to a [bug in picocli lib](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/2309), the `-d` & `-p` options, appear twice in the usage printout
